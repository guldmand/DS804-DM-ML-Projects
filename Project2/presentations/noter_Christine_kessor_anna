KNN
----------

using PCA1 (X) and PCA2 (Y), knn = 2, k=11

Confusion matrix


Evaluation of K nearest neigbour

Score value
Value of k


Evaluating Accuracy score as a function of test size with k = 2
Evaluating Accuracy score as a function of test size with k = 11


Chosing KNN 2, and 11 (Grid search)

Tranning or test score, should not tune using test, should tune using trainning

ALWAYS tune parameters using training






Gusian Naive bayes
------------------------------



Confussion matrix, different test size


Test size vs. accuracy score



Decision Tree
------------------------------
critirion = gini ... how many was missclassified
cirtiron = entropy ... how many was missclassified
confusion matrix

test size vs 


Ginni is best because it dont predict anyone with breast cancer as not having brest cancer







SVM
------------------------------

Kernel: rbf
C = 10

Gamma = 1, gamma = 10

changing C

no gamma for linear kernel



rbf kernel (high dimensional data)


Features of dataset:
Everything, but show it








Comparing cernels

Accuracy (y axis)
C-Value (X)


Methods:
Linear kernel
RBF kernel
Ploy kjernel
Sigmooid kernel






DATA
------------------------------------


Scale (standard scaler)

Normalization




GAN (Creating synhtetic data)
